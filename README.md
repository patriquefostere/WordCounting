I like the vocabulary of Jane Eyre so I wanted to go through and find the words that were least used. The problem now is that the list of all the words that occur exactly once is over 5000.
TODO: cross reference against this https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english/blob/master/google-10000-english.txt - most common english words. Any words that are in this list (or close, somehow) can be ignored.
